                        <p>Hello, I am Zannatul Binta Bahar. I am a little bit talented,
                            BUT I want to become a freelance/remote website/app developer.
                            I absolutely hated the routine life and other things related to a 9â€“5 job.
                            Currently I'm working on revising my JavaScript skills.
                            I have worked with HTML and CSS for about 1 years.
                            Now I want to work on JavaScript more as there are better growth opportunities.
                            Planning on doing a certification in MERN stack so I can get into full stack development
                            which I believe is going to be a great career choice for the future.

                            Recently, I completed a BSC degree , including <b>Computer Science & Engineering
                            </b> at the <b>International Islamic University,Chittagong</b> and I am now fully
                            unemployed and searching a good job.</p>
