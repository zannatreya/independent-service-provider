                <h5>Goal:I want to become a freelance/remote website/app developer.
                    I absolutely hated the routine life and other things related to a 9â€“5 job.
                    Currently I'm working on revising my JavaScript skills.
                    I have worked with HTML and CSS for about 1 years.
                    Now I want to work on JavaScript more as there are better growth opportunities.
                    Planning on doing a certification in MERN stack so I can get into full stack development
                    which I believe is going to be a great career choice for the future. </h5>
