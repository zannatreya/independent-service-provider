                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Authentication verifies who the user is.</li>
                                        <li>It works through passwords, one-time pins, biometric information, and other information provided or entered by the user.</li>
                                        <li>It is the first step of a good identity and access management process.</li>
                                        <li>It is visible to and partially changeable by the user.</li>
                                        <li><em>Example:</em> By verifying their identity, employees can gain access to an HR application that includes their personal pay information, vacation time, and 401K data.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <strong>Authentication</strong>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Authorization determines what resources a user can access.</li>
                                        <li>It works through settings that are implemented and maintained by the organization.</li>
                                        <li>It always takes place after authentication.</li>
                                        <li>It isnâ€™t visible to or changeable by the user.</li>
                                        <li><em>Example:</em> Once their level of access is authorized, employees and HR managers can access different levels of data based on the permissions set by the organization.</li>
                                    </ul>
